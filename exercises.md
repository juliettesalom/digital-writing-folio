- [x] answer questions
- [x] add notes about readings to [Readings](readings.md)

### Questions

#### What types of writing do you do (ie fiction, nonfiction, poetry, or other)?

- fiction - most of my writing is fiction because i find sitting down and writing a short story the most accessible type of writing.
- nonfiction - i've dipped my toe into the waters of creative nonfiction but i'd like to commit more time to this genre.
- screenwriting - i probably most enjoy screenwriting, although i rarely practice it. with other types of writing, pieces are complete once the piece of writing is complete; screenwriting is only fully complete once the film is made. 
- poetry - i dabble but rarely.

#### What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?

- microsoft word 
- qwerty 
- laptop
- my desk
- notes app on iphone and computer
- early mornings

#### How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?

- the easy layout of word and my familiarity with it makes it the easiest platform for me to write. i don't have to think about how i'm to put words on the page in a literal sense, i just let me fingers work subconciously and word captures that
- the keyboard layout, similar to my relationship with word, facilitates my writing in a sub-conciously easy way.
- the accessibility and flexibility of having a laptop means, if i have to, i can take my writing anywhere i want to go. although i prefer routine and consistency, even just moving my writing from my desk to my bed to the floor of my room is facilitated because of the portablility of my laptop.
- my desk is my comfort zone of writing. when i sit at my desk i feel like stuff will get done. perhaps my desk constrains me in a creative sense, if i were to write in other locations/environments/atmospheres, i may find new inspiration for my writing. 
- i use the notes app on my phone excessively, but only for single sentences or ideas, not for longer pieces. i use it as a place to leave notes that remind me of what to work on later
- if writing isn't done early in my mornings, it will not be done. early mornings are a tool that both faciliate and constrain my writing. if i were to be able to write at other times in the day, i owuldn't be limited.


## Week 2

### Questions

#### How is electronic literature different from print literature?

- Electronic literature is literature made for the purpose of being consumed digitally. Whereas print literature can be, now in our ever-evolving word of technology, be consumed in many forms (i.e. audiobooks, print, online, on tablets/phones, etc.), electronic literature is made to be exclusively published on one type of medium (being an electronic device). 
- Consuming print literature may take more effort to actively particpate in that say TV, where it is easy to passively let content wash over you, electronic literature in a way goes beyond the active practice of reading. With the choose-your-own-adventure format a popular one amongst electronic literature, it is this type of interactive mode that electronic literature exists in that demands even more of an active participation from the consumer than just reading a book would entail. In a way, the interactive nature of some electronic literature demands attention in a way that allows the consumer to be, momentarily, a creator. If choosing one's adventure creates their own story, consumers become some sort of author in this process.
- Whereas print literature existed for a long time, electronic literature is still relatively new and is still, and forever will be, developing.
- The accessibility of print and electronic literature differs immensely, how one can get their hands on these pieces may be more or less accessible, depending on the text and the parameters in which surround it.
- The limits of the page does not define electronic literature.

#### What are some of the qualities of electronic literature?

- The interactive nature of the medium forces consumers to partipate in an active way. It's incredibly, if not impossible, to consume some types of electronic literature passively. 
- Often times, the protagonist is 'you', the works are created, unlike most print literature, using second-person persepctive. Second-person creates more complicity with interacting users and second-person.
- Can be infinite.
- The medium in which it is performed/published is on an electronic device. Wether a phone/laptop/tablet, it can only be consumed through technology.
- Electronic literature is made to be consumed exclusively on one medium, if it were to be printed out, the literature would not be combatible. 
- Conceptual work can be apart of it.
- Can't physically see how far there is to go of a piece, meaning that the reader has to engage with the piece for an unknown amount of time. The sink-cost fallacy I think plays into this, meaning that it's tempting to not finish a piece if the reader can't see/know how long the piece is, so investing time and effort into a piece that they will never finish feels disappointing.
- There will always be a work that will be an outlier, no matter the parameters or rules surrounding electronic literature.
- There are no gatekeepers of electronic literature.
- It is organic.
- You have to learn a work to be able to read a work. Like learning an instrument before you play it.
- What is it doing materially? What is it the user does that changes the piece? How does the piece change with the user?


### Taroko Gorge remix: [Toy Garbage](https://nickm.com/taroko_gorge/toy_garbage/) by Talan Memmott

#### What aspects of the remix are the same?

- The way the poem moves, the lines that appear in the rhythm they're intended to be read, moving the reader along with the motion of the poem. 
- Although the content of the poem is vastly different, the way in which the lines are structured is quite similar. Often the lines will read a noun then verb then another noun, the action of one things doing something to another thing is borrowed from Taroko Gorge.

#### What aspects of the remix are different?

- The punctuation of Toy Garbage differs from Taroko Gorge in that it is filled with exclamation marks, prompting an excited/enthusiastic tone to the poem.
- The colour scheme is very different, from minimal colour other than the deep grass green background and the soft pink text to a background made up of panels of four colours in pastel: pinky red, green, yellow and blue, colours soft enough to be the background of a child's bedroom or play centre.
- The type is different, from the basic san-serifed type of Taroko Gorge to the rounded, capitalised, almost hand-written-esque type of Toy Garbage.
- The title is different, but borrows the first letters of the words Taroko Gorge, becoming Toy Garbage. 
- As mentioned above, the content of the poem is vastly different. Where the theme of Taroko Gorge is the gorge itself, prompting imagery and descriptions of water and nature and trees and rocks, Toy Garbage instead prompts imagery of toys, of children's play, of verbs in relation to the movements of children.

#### Is the remix successful (why or why not)?

- The way the remix has borrowed the bones of the structure of Taroko Gorge and then applied this to a different theme/differe subject, being a volume of toys, works well in adopting a notion and using it on a different idea to create a new piece of art altogether. I think Toy Garbage borrows just enough from Taroko Gorge, in turn evolving everything else to have an undertone of consistencey related to the original poem, whilst now creating another poem of originality.
- The use of punctuation with the exclamation marks impacts of the reading of the poem, and with it the movement. It changes the tone to one of somewhat seriousness to one of humour.

### We Walk to You Remix

[When I go to dinner](https://diligent-zircon-sailfish.glitch.me)
- Creating this remix of We Walk to You has felt enlightening in realising how easy it is to make a piece my own, to remix it to become apart of my writing, by working with an already established form and tweaking in the ways I see fit. Understanding (to a certain extent) the code behind the original We Walk to You poem allowed me to change it, changing the colour and the font and the title and, ultimately, the entire poem itself. 
- The new poem I've created, although may still seemingly look similar to We Walk to You, now holds an entirely new meaning. When I go to dinner includes the names of both my parents and the names of their parents (my grandparents), as well as 'me'. Due to the use of their names, the poem becomes very personal in its meaning, but the intimacy of the absurdity of some of the sentences (e.g. 'Rose yells to Bobbie') only remains absurd to me, knowing the relationships these people have to each other. To any other reader, these are names yelling/whispering/lying/talking to each other, to me, these are people with loaded relationships and hidden feelings toward one another, behaving in a way that, if the reader knows these people personally, is absurdly hilarious. This way, the poem becomes more like an inside joke, its full effect reserved for only a few select people who were to read the poem.
- Experiementing with this remix has made me pay more attention to explicit examples of other digital literature work I like and would consider emulating. Now that I have an idea of how I can make another work my own through remixing, the options for the tools I now have access to to create my own work feels exponential.

### Class presentations

Watching the presentations of my peers present the digital creative works they have studied has been helpful inspiration for my own creative piece. Seeing the sheer variety and diversity of types of digital literature provides me with an abundance of opportunities to select one as the path I wish my piece to go down. The piece I chose for my own case study, Judy Malloy's Uncle Roger, is itself quiet inspiring in its simplicity of format and design, whilst prompting an array of intriguing stories and nuanced themes that underpin them. I like the idea of experiencing a story anew each time it is read, the way Malloy has constructed her piece so to never get the same one story after a reading.
I also like the idea of using my digital literature piece as a space that is a direct descendant of a known internet phenomenom, being the chat room. As in [A Compendium of Failed Relationships](http://cordite.org.au/poetry/game/a-compendium-of-failed-relationships/), the different chat windows and internet tabs popping up feel very reminiscent of an internet I know and have grown up with. Maybe within this idea I could explore how the internet is being used to sustain relationships in a completely online, unreal mode. 
The remixs we have made so far in class have also influenced me to consider doing a poetry piece for my creative project. One of the works presented on in class especially has inspired me, being bpNichol's [First Screening](http://vispo.com/bp/firstscreening.mp4) kinetic concrete poem. I like the tactility of the concrete poetry, how it not only can be read but can be felt in its form. I also really like the idea of the poem or piece of work moving by itself, with no reader intervention. As intriguing as the user-orientated form is in clicking through a story or poem from hypertext, the idea of just letting a piece unravel and move itself is also really engaging.

## Week 5

### Notes

Not present in class due to sickness :( Caught up on recordings from home.

- HTML - W3C
- IDE - Integrated Development Environment

Making own CV / website : juliettesalom.github.io - not working? must check up on this with Benjamin when next in class

Hypertext fiction:
- non-linear in terms of choose-your-own-adventure/postmodernist/experiemental
- can't just make any narrative and link it together in a hypertext format, there has to be a purpose for the mode
- how is hypertext different to fiction? the platforms differ, point of view (second person), non-linear, planning (more of it, more formulaic), increased complexity of multi-directional narrative, pacing is controlled by the psychicality of the text, recognise that whole sections of the text may not be read

Making a story using twine, learning to use github desktop, netlify and visual studio code.

I'm finding twine easy enough to use and I like the clean layout of the program, it feels very user-friendly for beginners. I think I'll probably go down the path of using twine to create my story for my creative project.
