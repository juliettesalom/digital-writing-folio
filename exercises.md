### Questions

#### What types of writing do you do (ie fiction, nonfiction, poetry, or other)?

- fiction - most of my writing is fiction because i find sitting down and writing a short story the most accessible type of writing.
- nonfiction - i've dipped my toe into the waters of creative nonfiction but i'd like to commit more time to this genre.
- screenwriting - i probably most enjoy screenwriting, although i rarely practice it. with other types of writing, pieces are complete once the piece of writing is complete; screenwriting is only fully complete once the film is made. 
- poetry - i dabble but rarely.

#### What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?

- microsoft word 
- qwerty 
- laptop
- my desk
- notes app on iphone and computer
- early mornings

#### How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?

- the easy layout of word and my familiarity with it makes it the easiest platform for me to write. i don't have to think about how i'm to put words on the page in a literal sense, i just let me fingers work subconciously and word captures that
- the keyboard layout, similar to my relationship with word, facilitates my writing in a sub-conciously easy way.
- the accessibility and flexibility of having a laptop means, if i have to, i can take my writing anywhere i want to go. although i prefer routine and consistency, even just moving my writing from my desk to my bed to the floor of my room is facilitated because of the portablility of my laptop.
- my desk is my comfort zone of writing. when i sit at my desk i feel like stuff will get done. perhaps my desk constrains me in a creative sense, if i were to write in other locations/environments/atmospheres, i may find new inspiration for my writing. 
- i use the notes app on my phone excessively, but only for single sentences or ideas, not for longer pieces. i use it as a place to leave notes that remind me of what to work on later
- if writing isn't done early in my mornings, it will not be done. early mornings are a tool that both faciliate and constrain my writing. if i were to be able to write at other times in the day, i owuldn't be limited.
