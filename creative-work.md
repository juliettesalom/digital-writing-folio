# Creative work 

## TO DO
- [x] brainstorm ideas for creative work
- [] map story/plan story of creative work
- [] work out logistics of work: how long? what program?
- [] use twine to start making creative work
- [] make powerpoint slides
- [] submit proposal
- [] finalise story/finish planning story
- [] map story onto twine
- [] stylise with font/colour/images


### Brainstorm

- I'm wanting to work with an idea that is relevant, if not intrinsic, to the internet/web/computer/digital space. There has to be a solid reason for WHY this piece of work will be made as digital literature. It has to not work as print literature, it has to be exclusively suitable to a digital medium.
- Online chat forums between a range of characters could work, where the reader takes the identity of the protagonist and they chat to a variety of personalities. Or perhaps they're chatting to just one other person, and the reader themself takes on the identity of a range of different personalitities - kind of like catfishing. 
- Creating a catfish story could be really interesting, especially as catfishing is something that plays out exclusively online, so making a digital story about someone being catfished not only makes sense but the mode would benefit the story's effect. Telling the story of a catfishing scandal from the perspective of a catfish would also be super interesting, as these stories are often told from the victim's perspective. Could have a pretty emotionally uncomfortable effect on the user to have to assume the role of a catfish - a morally bad thing.
- I've been pretty inspired by a lot of the e-literature works we've been looking at in class that were made in the late '90s and early 2000s. The aesthetic of the time feels very early-tech, unpolished, DIY, pixelated, cool. Also the idea that these stories were being written and created using a technology that was still in its infancy is really fascinating. Even if it was only twenty or so years ago, there's an immense novelty to the idea that people were still trying to figure out how to use the internet, and what the potential of it was for creativity.
- This reminds me a lot of the Y2K bug. As a Gen Z person in my early twenties (born in 1999), I haven't lived in a world pre-internet. From early primary school, we had a home desktop computer in our house. I distinctively remember learning to handwrite and writing the letters as I knew them from our computer's keyobard to the teacher's dismay. Although the internet in a lot of ways feels as scary and powerful as ever, the accessibility to it and normalcy of almost everyone using it has taken away some of that naive fear of the unknown in the way I imagine people in 1999 felt it. The idea that all the computers in world would suddenly stop working because people weren't sure if they could handle the calendar year ticking over from 1999 to 2000 and that there might've been some sort of computer apocalypse feels kind of hilarious to me.  
- I'm leaning toward this idea. Maybe the story could be that the user/protagonist is charged with having to fix the Y2K bug before the clock runs out and the year 2000 begins - but with science fiction elements of a computer apocalyse. Tech sci-fi perhaps, with melodramatic escaltions of computers turning on the humans and what not. This will be a VERY HEAVILY fictionalised story of the Y2K bug, I'm less interested in going into the technicalities of what actually happened to the computers, more interested in re-appropriating the idea of computers taking over due to the mere event of the calendar changing.

### Story plan

- Reader is tasked to fixing the Y2K bug before the clock runs out and the year ticks over to 2000. If they don't fix the bug, the computers could take over the world and start the computer apocalypse.
- The story will eventually divide into two routes: 1- the bug is being fixed and order is restored, the year 2000 comes and all is ok; 2- the bug isn't fixed in time and the computer apocalypse begins, the computers hold the internet and all technology captive, the user has the choice to joining forces with the computer army or dying. Joining the computer army will also lead to death. 
- Because the story will be framed in that there is a countdown until the year 2000, the amount of minutes until midnight of December 31 1999 may be a good measure for time for how long the creative piece should be. 5 minutes?
- There's only one path to go forward on, wrong options will always eventually lead to death.
- According to the Wikipedia page, there were six different approaches used to solve the Y2K bug. Only after User does all six of these solutions will the bug be fixed and the apocalypse avoided.

Story beats/story outline:
- User is told the situation: 5 minutes until the year 2000, only they can fix the bug in time to stop the computer army from taking over.
With 5 minutes to go:
- User can try to turn their computer off and on again. This doesn't work.
- User can go make a sandwich (this is going to be hungry work) OR call a friend for help.
- Making a sandwich: User brings back sandwich and fanta to their computer, to which they spill it all over. The computer fizzles, dies. Time runs out, the bug isn't fixed. The computers take over, User is the first to go.
- Call a friend: You ring your good friend, Bill Gates, and ask him what he'd do. He says that if anyone knew what to do about the Y2K bug, it'd be you, User. You thank Bill for his kind yet unhelpful words and hang up the phone.
- User has the option to not worry about the dates getting muddled up OR look into expanding the year date to a four-digit number.
- Not worry about the dates getting muddled up: User has the option to go to their friend's NYE party OR watch the countdown on their desktop computer, in anticipation of the apocalypse.
- Go to NYE party: before User can even put on both their shoes, the clock ticks over to year 2000, the Y2K bug isn't fixed and the computer apocalypse begins. The computers take over, User is the first to go.
- Watch countdown: the clock ticks over to year 2000, the Y2K bug isn't fixed and the computer apocalypse begins. The computers take over, User is the first to go.
- Expanding the year date: User enacts the first and purest solution by expanding the two-digit year dates to four-digits in all programs, files and databases. Although it will cost governments around the world millions of dollars, User is one step closer to fixing the bug.
