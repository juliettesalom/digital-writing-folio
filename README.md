## Artist statement
My creative work covers fiction in both the digital space and in print. This is work that challenges expectations, plays with form, has a unique tone, and overall, puts an emphasis on having a bit of fun. 

## Reflection
Over the course of the semester, my skills, knowledge, and experience in the digital writing space has grown from virtually zero to a now well-versed (but still amateur) toolkit of digital writing abilities. Beginning the subject, I felt slightly overwhelmed but the sheer enormity of things I didn’t know when it comes to creating writing for the online space. 

Having never coded before or attempted to make electronic literature, everything felt new at the beginning of this class. However, reading works by other writers and understanding their creative practices – as I did in depth with my case study presentation on digital writer Judy Malloy and her piece Uncle Roger – digital writing became a little less daunting. Understanding how the sausage was made, and then consuming that sausage as the end product of a completed work of fiction or poem, gave me the context I needed to understand more thoroughly the capabilities of the digital writing medium. Whereas the freedom of the format initially scared me a little, the more digital creative work I read and understood how was made, the freedom of the format is what became most appealing about the medium.

Trying the different exercises in class on the varying platforms (such as HTML, Twine, Inform 7, Bitsy, Glitch, etc.) gave me a broad range of avenues to choose from to create my own creative work within. Trialling platforms like Inform 7 and Bitsy allowed me to recognise that Twine would be the appropriate place to create my own story, both because the ease and accessibility of the platform for a beginner like me would be better suited to my skills, and because the idea I had in mind for my electronic literature piece was a choose-your-own-adventure style story, best suited to Twine. 

Through the exercises in class and by researching questions and answers on the online Twine forums, I developed my Twine skills and experimented with different aesthetic and interactive elements to my story. I found that once I had the story’s plot and scenes sorted, I was able to spend my time trialling different styles and looks and other creative choices for my story. Playing around with sound was both fun and difficult, getting audio files to work and play where I wanted them to in the story, but ultimately the effort was worth it for the effect it has on my finished piece. 

Once I got my head around the basics of Twine, I found it pretty easy to use, allowing me the freedom to build on pieces and try new things. Having never used this program before, the skills and understanding I now have means I can, and am likely to, use it again in the future of my creative practice to make more stories. My digital writing skills have developed immensely over the period of this semester, meaning I now can create digital writing in my own time, and what I don’t know, I now know how to find the answers.
