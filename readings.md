#### [Decolonize E-literature? On Weeding the E-Lit Garden](https://electronicbookreview.com/essay/decolonize-e-literature-on-weeding-the-e-lit-garden/)
- The concept of discussing electronic literature as a garden that needs weeding was an apt metaphor in discussing the decolonization of the field.

### Literature

#### [Taroko Gorge](https://aus01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcollection.eliterature.org%2F3%2Fwork.html%3Fwork%3Dtaroko-gorge&data=04%7C01%7CS3866682%40student.rmit.edu.au%7C6cb697dd73e54a843ff708d9f75adf7d%7Cd1323671cdbe4417b4d4bdb24b51316b%7C0%7C0%7C637812791944371960%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=gKYvD8NNsHEDSLCNKNmOp97eTW0CQVYA8t6b0iF%2F7Zk%3D&reserved=0)
- The visual aesthetic of the piece, the way it moved on its own accord and it is up to the user to interact by following along at the speed the text demands. The eternal nature of the piece was both intruiging and fustrating, watching it go on forever whilst being fustrated that it would never end. The movement reflecting the gorge, movement reflecting the images the words conjures, is something that print literature can't do as well, which I loved in this piece.

#### [First Draft of the Revolution](https://aus01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcollection.eliterature.org%2F3%2Fwork.html%3Fwork%3Dfirst-draft-of-the-revolution&data=04%7C01%7CS3866682%40student.rmit.edu.au%7C6cb697dd73e54a843ff708d9f75adf7d%7Cd1323671cdbe4417b4d4bdb24b51316b%7C0%7C0%7C637812791944371960%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=NTM%2BcfZr2oTgzdvZzK0GVtnzpsCmvtyjisl8XTzdRL8%3D&reserved=0)
- The turning of the page, being an electronic re-creation of a page, was an interesting emergence of print literature with the screen. The different links to click and different images to play around with that took the user to different places allowed me to participate in the piece in a way that made me feel like a was 'playing'.

#### [Shade](https://aus01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpr-if.org%2Fplay%2Fshade%2F&data=04%7C01%7CS3866682%40student.rmit.edu.au%7C6cb697dd73e54a843ff708d9f75adf7d%7Cd1323671cdbe4417b4d4bdb24b51316b%7C0%7C0%7C637812791944371960%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=ydZD9VDlYKo%2FVSjylEl1RlTp%2Bhrv6LxhfplFpu%2FzxzU%3D&reserved=0)
- Shade was fustrating as a first-time reader of electronic literature, although the interactive nature of it, the idea that I was in (somewhat) control of the protagonist, was incredibly fascinating. 


## Week 2

#### [Enlightening Interactive Fiction: Andrew Plotkin's Shade](http://electronicbookreview.com/essay/enlightening-interactive-fiction-andrew-plotkins-shade/)
- After attempting to 'read' Shade and not getting very far, reading this article about Andrew Plotkin's Shade was really enlightening in understanding how the piece was designed and where it has the potential to go if the reader was to stay with it until the end. The ideas it juggles in terms of the reader of Shade struggling to get to the end of the story mirrors the way in which the protagonist struggles to get free of the apartment they think they are confined to. Reading this article also gave me an appreciation of the author, I felt I had a better understanding of the author's intention.

#### [Kissing the Steak: the Poetry of Text Generators, 69-83](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/rmit/reader.action?docID=601923)
- The discussion of the Porto piece by Pedro Babosa relating to the numerous possibilities that a text can contain if there are numerous options for the way it can be constructed. "Every activation of the program produced 25 lines of text that present permutations of a text built from four subjects," being *granite*, *history*, *stone* and *longing/nostalgia*. The idea that all the ingredients for a text can exist on a page, or on the screen, or even just exist within the human language, is an idea somewhat articulated in this poem. The words to create poetry, the tools to create any art, are forever at our disposale.

#### [Introduction](https://ap01-a.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/delivery/61RMIT_INST:RMITU/12268640080001341?lang=en&viewerServiceCode=AlmaViewer)
- The idea of potential literature is one that thoroughly relates to electronic literature; infinite attempts to evolve an ever-expanding catalogue of mediums of literature, with so many of these modes taking place electronically. When the web/the computer come into play, literature that was previously restricted to the limits of the page, or at least to the limits of the physical tangibility of a product (this could be beyond the page, with other materials to be considered), the possibilities for the presentation and exploration of literature became boundless. The potential, in other words, became infinite. Queneau's definition of Oulipo's work, the group of ten founding members from a diverse range of disciplineries (mathematicians, writers, university professors, pataphysicians), is "the search for new forms and structures that may be used by writers in any way they see fit." In other words: *potential literature*. 

#### [Potential Literature](https://ap01-a.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/delivery/61RMIT_INST:RMITU/12268640080001341?lang=en&viewerServiceCode=AlmaViewer)
- The differentiation in Potential Literature of fixed-form poetry and limited-form poetry is what the author says is a differentiation that must be "scrupulously distinguished". Limited-form poetry is described as "only the number of verses and the nature of verses and the nature of the subject are predetermined." Fixed-form poetry is described as obeying "strict rules concerning the length of its verses, the order, alternation, or repetition of rhymes, of words, or even of entire verses." The difference in these are fascinating, a difference I hadn't been aware of before.

### Literature

#### [Uncle Roger](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/works/uncle-roger/index.html)
*CHOSEN PIECE*
- The graphics in Uncle Roger, the pixelated, bright-coloured, bock-coloured images with the basic Times New Roman typeface is reminiscent of a period of early web design. The opening image, of a shaded drawing of a computer witht the title of the text and the author's name on the screen feels like an apt introduction: an onscreen title for an exlusively-on screen experience. Written and created by a women in a period and in an industry where there is lack of female representation, the piece focuses on a female persepctive, in a way with sensitvity and humour. 

#### [Qing's Quest](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/works/quings-quest-vii/index.html)
- This interactive work feels more computer-game like than the others I've explored. From the chirpy time-filling music that fills the background space to the second-person perspective used to place *you* at the centre of the story, Qing's Quest is the type of chose-your-own-adventure story I'm more familiar with in a narrative-gaming sense. The enthusiastic attitude of the language, the way the game feels very positive and happy and supportive of the player, feels mirrored in the aesthetic, e.g. the twinkling stars around chosen words, the bright pink/ bright green, the capitalised letters. It screams *fun*.

#### [With those we love alive](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/works/with-those-we-love-alive/empress.html)
- The advice before the piece begins to have a pen or sharpie at hand, "something that can write on skin," ties the electronic nature of the piece with the physicality of the outside world, the reality of the human sitting behind the screen participating with the piece. The simple instructions (purple links change, pink links can move forward) encourages the accessibility of the piece, something that can stop a reader before they've even started. Without having to neccessarily learn how to read this piece before attempting to read it, this work breaks down some of those barriers that exist within electronic literature, or at least makes it easier for the reader to cross them. The audio element is another way the line is blurred between the electronic piece and the reality we participate with it within, it is thoroughly interactive.
