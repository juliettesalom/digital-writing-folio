#### [Decolonize E-literature? On Weeding the E-Lit Garden](https://electronicbookreview.com/essay/decolonize-e-literature-on-weeding-the-e-lit-garden/)
- The concept of discussing electronic literature as a garden that needs weeding was an apt metaphor in discussing the decolonization of the field.

#### [Electronic Literature: what is it?](https://eliterature.org/pad/elp.html)

#### [The Origins of Electronic Literature: An Overview](https://www.bloomsburycollections.com/book/electronic-literature-as-digital-humanities-contexts-forms-practices/ch1-the-origins-of-electronic-literature-an-overview)


### Literature

#### [Taroko Gorge](https://aus01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcollection.eliterature.org%2F3%2Fwork.html%3Fwork%3Dtaroko-gorge&data=04%7C01%7CS3866682%40student.rmit.edu.au%7C6cb697dd73e54a843ff708d9f75adf7d%7Cd1323671cdbe4417b4d4bdb24b51316b%7C0%7C0%7C637812791944371960%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=gKYvD8NNsHEDSLCNKNmOp97eTW0CQVYA8t6b0iF%2F7Zk%3D&reserved=0)
- The visual aesthetic of the piece, the way it moved on its own accord and it is up to the user to interact by following along at the speed the text demands. The eternal nature of the piece was both intruiging and fustrating, watching it go on forever whilst being fustrated that it would never end. The movement reflecting the gorge, movement reflecting the images the words conjures, is something that print literature can't do as well, which I loved in this piece.

#### [First Draft of the Revolution](https://aus01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcollection.eliterature.org%2F3%2Fwork.html%3Fwork%3Dfirst-draft-of-the-revolution&data=04%7C01%7CS3866682%40student.rmit.edu.au%7C6cb697dd73e54a843ff708d9f75adf7d%7Cd1323671cdbe4417b4d4bdb24b51316b%7C0%7C0%7C637812791944371960%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=NTM%2BcfZr2oTgzdvZzK0GVtnzpsCmvtyjisl8XTzdRL8%3D&reserved=0)
- The turning of the page, being an electronic re-creation of a page, was an interesting emergence of print literature with the screen. The different links to click and different images to play around with that took the user to different places allowed me to participate in the piece in a way that made me feel like a was 'playing'.

#### [Shade](https://aus01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpr-if.org%2Fplay%2Fshade%2F&data=04%7C01%7CS3866682%40student.rmit.edu.au%7C6cb697dd73e54a843ff708d9f75adf7d%7Cd1323671cdbe4417b4d4bdb24b51316b%7C0%7C0%7C637812791944371960%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=ydZD9VDlYKo%2FVSjylEl1RlTp%2Bhrv6LxhfplFpu%2FzxzU%3D&reserved=0)
- Shade was fustrating as a first-time reader of electronic literature, although the interactive nature of it, the idea that I was in (somewhat) control of the protagonist, was incredibly fascinating.

#### [Enlightening Interactive Fiction: Andrew Plotkin's Shade](http://electronicbookreview.com/essay/enlightening-interactive-fiction-andrew-plotkins-shade/)
- After attempting to 'read' Shade and not getting very far, reading this article about Andrew Plotkin's Shade was really enlightening in understanding how the piece was designed and where it has the potential to go if the reader was to stay with it until the end. The ideas it juggles in terms of the reader of Shade struggling to get to the end of the story mirrors the way in which the protagonist struggles to get free of the apartment they think they are confined to. Reading this article also gave me an appreciation of the author, I felt I had a better understanding of the author's intention.

#### [Kissing the Steak: the Poetry of Text Generators, 69-83](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/rmit/reader.action?docID=601923)
- The discussion of the Porto piece by Pedro Babosa relating to the numerous possibilities that a text can contain if there are numerous options for the way it can be constructed. "Every activation of the program produced 25 lines of text that present permutations of a text built from four subjects," being *granite*, *history*, *stone* and *longing/nostalgia*. The idea that all the ingredients for a text can exist on a page, or on the screen, or even just exist within the human language, is an idea somewhat articulated in this poem. The words to create poetry, the tools to create any art, are forever at our disposale.

#### [Introduction](https://ap01-a.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/delivery/61RMIT_INST:RMITU/12268640080001341?lang=en&viewerServiceCode=AlmaViewer)
- The idea of potential literature is one that thoroughly relates to electronic literature; infinite attempts to evolve an ever-expanding catalogue of mediums of literature, with so many of these modes taking place electronically. When the web/the computer come into play, literature that was previously restricted to the limits of the page, or at least to the limits of the physical tangibility of a product (this could be beyond the page, with other materials to be considered), the possibilities for the presentation and exploration of literature became boundless. The potential, in other words, became infinite. Queneau's definition of Oulipo's work, the group of ten founding members from a diverse range of disciplineries (mathematicians, writers, university professors, pataphysicians), is "the search for new forms and structures that may be used by writers in any way they see fit." In other words: *potential literature*. 

#### [Potential Literature](https://ap01-a.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/delivery/61RMIT_INST:RMITU/12268640080001341?lang=en&viewerServiceCode=AlmaViewer)
- The differentiation in Potential Literature of fixed-form poetry and limited-form poetry is what the author says is a differentiation that must be "scrupulously distinguished". Limited-form poetry is described as "only the number of verses and the nature of verses and the nature of the subject are predetermined." Fixed-form poetry is described as obeying "strict rules concerning the length of its verses, the order, alternation, or repetition of rhymes, of words, or even of entire verses." The difference in these are fascinating, a difference I hadn't been aware of before.

### Literature

#### [Uncle Roger](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/works/uncle-roger/index.html)
*CHOSEN PIECE*
- The graphics in Uncle Roger, the pixelated, bright-coloured, bock-coloured images with the basic Times New Roman typeface is reminiscent of a period of early web design. The opening image, of a shaded drawing of a computer witht the title of the text and the author's name on the screen feels like an apt introduction: an onscreen title for an exlusively-on screen experience. Written and created by a women in a period and in an industry where there is lack of female representation, the piece focuses on a female persepctive, in a way with sensitvity and humour. 

#### [Qing's Quest](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/works/quings-quest-vii/index.html)
- This interactive work feels more computer-game like than the others I've explored. From the chirpy time-filling music that fills the background space to the second-person perspective used to place *you* at the centre of the story, Qing's Quest is the type of chose-your-own-adventure story I'm more familiar with in a narrative-gaming sense. The enthusiastic attitude of the language, the way the game feels very positive and happy and supportive of the player, feels mirrored in the aesthetic, e.g. the twinkling stars around chosen words, the bright pink/ bright green, the capitalised letters. It screams *fun*.

#### [With those we love alive](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/works/with-those-we-love-alive/empress.html)
- The advice before the piece begins to have a pen or sharpie at hand, "something that can write on skin," ties the electronic nature of the piece with the physicality of the outside world, the reality of the human sitting behind the screen participating with the piece. The simple instructions (purple links change, pink links can move forward) encourages the accessibility of the piece, something that can stop a reader before they've even started. Without having to neccessarily learn how to read this piece before attempting to read it, this work breaks down some of those barriers that exist within electronic literature, or at least makes it easier for the reader to cross them. The audio element is another way the line is blurred between the electronic piece and the reality we participate with it within, it is thoroughly interactive.

#### [Beyond Taxonomy: Digital Poetics and the Problem of Reading](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/rmit/reader.action?docID=3338652&ppg=306)
- As having discussed in class, a definition of 'digital writing' (or digital poetry) has been hard to land on, with many contradictions and exceptions. But as we explore and read more digital writing, we're beginning to see and understand that, in art and literature, there will always be exceptions to the rule. This article's definition is simple and broad, vague whilst inclusive: "the object in question (must) be 'digital', mediated through digital technology, and that it be called 'poetry' (or writing) by its author or by a critical reader."
- First generation digital texuality: hypertext
- I like the idea that this article refers to, that "within digital poetry, the application of a given technology varies from one practitioner to the next, even from one work to the next by the same practitioner." Rather than a piece of art be the same experience for every person who consumes it (which doesn't happen anyway, even with texts like film or books that don't physically change from one reading to the next), even single time a digital piece is consumed, it is a different experience. We may get different readings from a film each time we see it, noticing things we haven't before, each time we consume digital poetry, the poetry itself may be changed. The product is always in flux, like the reader, and so no two readings of a text can ever be the same, even within the experience of one person. The evolution of a text is comparable to the evolution of the reader; maybe we evolve with the texts and the texts with us. This idea is re-emphasised in this article as the author writes: "Like a musician playing an instrument, a user could be said to play an application."
- I like the idea (from Xylo by Peter Howard) of setting a piece to music and when the music ends, so does the text, closing the window automatically.
- Page 300: The poetics of the work override the poetry: the intertainment is more potent than the entertainment.

#### [Indistinguishable from Magic: Invisible Interfaces and Digital Literature as Demystifier](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/rmit/reader.action?docID=1680083)
- 1: "We cannot crave whatever is ubiquitous." Media does truly feel ubiquitous, especially for me, as someone who has lived almost all my life in the twenty-first century, media is everywhere all the time. A life without media is unimaginable, incomprehensible. The norm I grew up with was still a novelty to my parents when I was born, in some ways still is a novelty to them now. Everything I do is related to media.
- 3: "Ideally, the seamlessness of ubiquitous computing devices will make even choice itself recede into the background. In this imagined near future, things will simply happen and we will simply do." This consideration of digital creating as a merely passive activity feels dystopian yet familiar.
- The language used to describe interfaces, these tools of technology, paralell with that of trends that are everywhere at the moment, in food, in 'wellness', in clothes, these descriptors being: "natural, organic, invisible". We want everything to be simplified, to be as basic and 'clean' and easy as possible, even, or perhaps especially, when it comes to our technology. Using words like "natural", "organic" and "invisible" seem contradictory to the entire premise of technology. What is natural, organic or invisible about a computer? About the internet? About digital writing?
- 6: "In a decisive attempt not to reframe the interface as as even more invisible or more natural but to do away with it altogether, we read of predictions from IBM that within five years our brains will be synced with computing devices so that "if you just need to think about calling someone, it happens." How does this relate to art, though? To writing? If you just think about a poem, will it be created in full, without any more thought than that required? Or could we just think about the idea of writing a poem, and the computer will do it for us? The barrier between the digital world and our brains is becoming blurred, and there's no clearer way to see that than in digital literature, but surely computer programs cannot replace human minds creating digital literature altogther?

#### [Hypertext Fiction Ever After](https://www.bloomsburycollections.com/book/electronic-literature-as-digital-humanities-contexts-forms-practices/ch13-hypertext-fiction-ever-after)
- "If we want to consider both tree and forest, we need to see this genre as a machinic inflection of the general project of experimental writing." - The metaphor used in this quote I think speaks to the craft of writing beyond just electronic literature, seeing both the minutae and the bigger picture when it comes to writing.
- "After the web’s advent, hypertext moved from concept to utility, becoming as ubiquitous as indoor plumbing and electricity." - It's interesting to consider our relationship with the internet in this sense, thinking it a ubiquitous advent that is just there. With me, especially, I've lived most of my life with accesssibility to the internet, the idea of the internet being invented is something that feels foriegn in a world that so fundamentally relies and functions on it. For me, it is comparable to indoor plumbing and electricity. The creation of these things fall well before my time, and to imagine a world without them is to imagine a world old-fashioned and dysfunctional.
- "The noncommercial gift economy of the early World Wide Web made business exceedingly difficult for companies like Eastgate Systems, Inc. and Voyager." - The reality of making art in a capitlistic world unfortunately more often than not leads to the demise of creative ventures. The relationship with creating something to create something and then feeling like, or not having the option but to, have to make money off it in order to be able to keep creating is a complicated one- one that has prompted me as of late to consider what parts of my creativity I need to capitalise on in order to make a living, and what parts I can keep for myself and retain the joy that is creating.

#### [No Sense of an Ending: Hypertext Aesthetics](https://ap01-a.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/delivery/61RMIT_INST:RMITU/12269642080001341?lang=en&viewerServiceCode=AlmaViewer)
- "Hypertext is often understood as a medium of text, as an alter-native to ( among others) the codex format found in books, maga-zines, and bound manuscripts. It is often described as a mechanical ( computerized) system of reading and writing, in which the text is organized into a network of fragments and the connections between them." - A useful definition of hypertext.
- "When Ted Nelson first coined the word hypertext in 1965, he was thinking of a  new way of organizing text so that it could be read in a  sequence chosen by the reader, rather than followed only in the sequence laid down by the writer. However, since codex texts can also be read in sequences determined by the reader, what he in fact suggested was a system in which the writer could specify which sequences of reading would be available to the reader." - The availability of particular sequences to the reader is the difference between analogue fiction and digital. As it often is, the question is of accessibility. A reader of a fiction book may be able to flick forward and backward to other parts of a text, but a reader of digital fiction is afforded an easy and clean option to do so.
- "The activity of hypertext reading is often portrayed, · in contrast to codex reading, as a  kind of co-authorship, with the reader cre-ating her own text as she goes along." - As we often discuss in class, the relationship between the reader and the text becomes something similar to authorship, in the way they are making decisions in the design of their own story.

#### [Second perosn: roleplaying and story in games and playable media](https://ap01-a.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/delivery/61RMIT_INST:RMITU/12270521920001341?lang=en&viewerServiceCode=AlmaViewer)
- "Savoir-Faire is not only textbook but also laboratory. A substantial portion of the code exists only to reward undirected play." - The notion of creating space around the central action of a story in interactive fiction in order to encourage play that while may not be purposeful or neccessary to the story, is part of the fun of playing, is a notion in which I wish to explore in my own work. The whole idea of interactive fiction is to create an emersive world of play and games, and to be build up that world it is helpful for the reader or user to be given space to wander around and use trial and error to interact with different aspects of the game. The idea of play in interactive fiction feels almost, if not just as, important as the idea of plot and story.
- This piece reinforces this idea of play by discussing the idea of 'tinkering' in a story world when things become boring: "It is good if the tinkering is fun; better still if, subtly, it offers new perspective on the problem holding him up." Interactive fiction that encourages play can also use that play to encourage story. 

#### [Riddles - Twisty little passages: an approach to interactive fiction](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/rmit/reader.action?docID=5966542&ppg=54)
- "The true riddle is not merely enigmatic; it actually poses a question (a real one, although it need not be explicit) that is to be answered by the reader or listener - the riddlee." This description carries paralells with interactive fiction, the idea of posing a question in which it is the reader or users role to answer, or at least to attempt to. I like the comparison of riddles and interactive fiction, because riddles to me prompt a level of active participation that not all other literary ideas conjure. A riddle not only feels like a question, but a game provoking a child-like sense of play and wonder and using one's imagination, much like interactive fiction does.
- The relationship of riddler to riddlees feels very similar to that of the relationship between an author of interactive fiction and a user. The way in which authors create a story and the tools in which to read it, or sometimes solve it, and then hand this over to the user for them, in some ways, to become an author themselves, is comparable to the way riddlers hand over a riddle to the riddlee and allow them to carry it with them and play with it in order to 'solve it'. The passing around of story, the transferring of story from author to user, feels similar in both literary forms.

#### [The paradox of poetic gaming: evidence of everything exploding](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/rmit/detail.action?docID=3339803&pq-origsite=primo)
- "Poetic games are a type of computer game that has an explicit or implicit poetic agenda without scraficing or diminishing the phenomenological gameness that lies at its core." Playing a poetic game I can imagine would be a completely different experience to playing the typical computer game. Without weapons/enemies/the usual props the traditional games soure from, the user experience would be focused primarily on the story elements and the poetic nature of the piece of work. I wonder if I'd find a game of this nature boring, as I'm only used to games that are primarily goal-orientated or win-based. 
- "(Poetic games) critique and challenge players' hyper attention by confronting them with text material that requires deep attention for in-depth understanding and intertextual referencing." I think it would take some re-wiring of my game-brain to get used to a poetic game, but it'd be very cool to try, especially as inspiration for my own creative work, however I'm inclined to think that I wouldn't be able to summon deep attention for a game. Maybe it takes going in with a literature-minded brain to be ready to absorb the poetic game. Even still, I think I require some passivity when I consume stories; I want some of the work to be done for me. Most interactive fiction is appealing to me if I'm given options and choices, but having full control and needing to surrender my full attention feels like too much work for a type of consumption I normally like to do when I'm ready to tune out.

#### [Poetic playlands: poetry, interface, and video game engines](https://www.bloomsburycollections.com/book/electronic-literature-as-digital-humanities-contexts-forms-practices/ch30-poetic-playlands-poetry-interface-and-video-game-engines)
- "This familiarity operates as a foothold, a climbing rope, a ladder, a doorway into what is otherwise a strange foreign world for most users/readers." In his pondering on why his digital poetry/art games are more attractive to users compared to his other work, Jason Nelson points out that familiarity can be a strong tool in engaging users who are otherwise unfamiliar or new to this type of work. For me personally, as a new reader of digital literature, I can definitely relate to this sentiment. Digital games and computer games seem like a common ground of nostalgia for most people who, as Nelson points out, have grown up after the 1970s. Basing a work that is uniquely unfamiliar in its mode in a very familiar product, such as the style of Mario Brothers, feels like a smart choice in engaging users that might otherwise be put off by the newness of form that digital literature is for lots of people.
- " Additionally, many digital poems are inherently born from non-linear thinking and writing... But interactive technologies, and especially the game format, offer the poet the chance to make their poems not only multi-dimensional, but also interactive and multi-temporal." When Nelson explains it like this it seems to only make sense to partner video games with poetry. The convergence of the two seems absurd on the surface, but the non-linear nature of creation and of consumption means that these forms and types of art actually complement each other immensely.

#### [Excavating Logics of White Supremacy in Electronic Literature: Antiracism as Infrastructural Critique] (https://electronicbookreview.com/essay/excavating-logics-of-white-supremacy-in-electronic-literature-antiracism-as-infrastructural-critique/) 
- "White supremacy is mundane and understated, which is one of the reasons why it operates with impunity." 
- "In other words, my use of white supremacy is less concerned with the value of visual signifiers (e.g., color; skin tone, etc.) than it is with how hierarchies of difference use visual signifiers to project value onto bodies, to regulate aesthetics, and to distribute power inequitably."
- The discussion that takes place in this piece of the structures below the surface that allow white supremacy to function (and thrive) is as important as it is challenging. With a plethora of conditions that are at play, beginning to understand and explore these is the start to dismantling them. The depth with which this issue is discussed is thought-provoking, and I like the author's approach to the subject of focusing less on singular visual signifiers of race, but rather what structures exist that perpetuate a heirarchy and allow white supremacy to sustain.

#### [Arriving Simultaneously: Selections from a writer’s Notebook](https://thedigitalreview.com/issue00/arriving-simultaneously-notebook/index.html)
- "A writer's notebook is not a final paper but rather reflects the development of a work or series of works. In the informal, recursive, yet productive practice of creating notebooks online, ideas and sources are developed and slowly emerge."
- Judy Malloy's writer's notebook is a combination of imagery and text, organised in a neat and systematic way, using colour, diagrams and symbols to navigate the ideas she explores. Her transtition from a hard-copy notebook to a digital one seems a significant one, one that allowed her to produce her work for an audience and organise it in a succinct manner. This has prompted me to consider a digital writer's notebook for my own practice. Whilst I undertake most of my writing on my computer anyway, it all exists under singular Word documents. Creating an online platform in which to collate my work and ideas could allow me to draw on and from different pieces of work to benefit each other, perhaps streamlining my creative process.

#### [Publishing Electronic Literature](https://www.bloomsburycollections.com/book/electronic-literature-as-digital-humanities-contexts-forms-practices/ch22-publishing-electronic-literature)
- "Why seek a publisher for something which publishes itself?" This idea is really interesting and not one that I've thought about in those terms when it comes to electronic literature. If part of creating the literature and playing with form and aesthetic of a piece relies on the author playing with how the piece (and where/who to/what on) is to be published, then is there any need, or any such thing, as a publisher of electronic literature? Does that make electronic literature one of the more accessible mediums of writing to create work in that have a chance to be seen by an audience? Even if only an author's family and friends read their electronic literature piece, that is still more people than no one reading a copy of a manuscript sitting in a desk drawer waiting to be picked up by a publisher.
- "The current state of e-lit publishing is perhaps the natural order restored, before writing as creative practice became writing as a commercial concern." There seems like there is this dichotomy that exists, and one that I have even noticed in myself when it comes to creating my own writing, of making work that is honest to one's creative desires and work that is sellable. Is there a point to making work that, although maybe honest and meaningful to the author, no one sees from sheer lack of commercial appeal? I would argue there is a point, but this practice isn't sustainable. Being an author that makes work and being an author that sells work may be the difference in the long run. Unfortunately, to keep being able to write as an author, something will have to sell. Making solely honest and meaningful, yet unsellable, work is not sustainable. But maybe there is a space in between? A happy medium?
